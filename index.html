                <p>Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
                    Before this, did you really know what live was?
                    Comprehend to the track, for it's why 'cause
                    Getting measures on the tip of the vibers
                    Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
                    Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
                    If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
                    Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
                    Afrocentric living is a big shrug
                    A life filled with that's what I love
                    A lower plateau is what we're above
                    If you diss us, we won't even think of
                    Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
                    This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
                    Like a box of positives is a plus, love
                    As the Tribe flies high like a dove</p>
